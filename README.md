# Autonomous Claw
This is the test and final code for the APSC 101 autonomous claw project. The objectives of the claw are to pick up a variety of items and transport them accurately and efficiently.

## Programs
[`servo_sonar.ino`](https://github.com/MatthewChow03/Autonomous-Claw/blob/main/servo_sonar.ino) a program to position a servo's angle based on sonar height

[`distance_algorithm_v1.ino`](https://github.com/MatthewChow03/Autonomous-Claw/blob/main/distance_algorithm_v1.ino) a program that opens and closes a claw with LED indicators of the algorithm's state

[`timeout_algorithm.ino`](https://github.com/MatthewChow03/Autonomous-Claw/blob/main/timeout_algorithm.ino) implementation of a timeout to reopen and close the claw when an object is unsuccessfully picked up

[`timeout_algorithm.ino`](https://github.com/MatthewChow03/Autonomous-Claw/blob/main/timeout_algorithm_v2.ino) fixed issue where timeout v1 would get stuck in the green phase, changed do while to a while loop
